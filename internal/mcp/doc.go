// Package mcp wires the official modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk MCP server into
// the application, reusing the same auth.Verifier as REST rather than a
// second verification implementation. internal/auth holds all
// protocol-agnostic verification logic shared by this package and
// internal/middleware (the REST-side adapter); neither adapter depends on
// the other. Request-scoped identity (internal/ctx) and logging
// (internal/log) are likewise independent, transport-agnostic packages this
// one depends on directly, so MCP tool logs get the same
// user_id/request_id correlation fields as REST without depending on the
// middleware package at all.
