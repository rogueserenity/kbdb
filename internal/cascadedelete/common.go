// Package cascadedelete implements the block/cascade/detach on_delete
// policy for deleting an item that may still be referenced by one or more
// Builds. Both the REST handlers (internal/handlers) and the MCP tools
// (internal/mcp) call the DeleteX function for the entity being deleted
// directly and map its result/error to their own response shape, rather
// than each reimplementing the find-then-decide-then-delete flow.
